    <h2><a href="/post/custody-deaths/">Chart: 10 times more people die in police collisions than in shootings</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      About 100 people a year die following contact with police in England and Wales. Public debate has often focused on deaths in custody or police shootings, but people are much more likely to die in collisions with police vehicles or in suicides following release from custody.

    <h2><a href="/post/common-prosecutions/">Chart: What offences are people most often prosecuted for?</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      About 1.4 million criminal cases were prosecuted in England and Wales last year. Motoring offences and minor non-violent offences such as TV licence evasion are the most commonly prosecuted, with many more cases in those categories dealt with by fixed penalties or other out-of-court disposals.

    <h2><a href="/post/dna-database/">Chart: One in ten of us is on the National DNA Database</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      About 5.3 million people in England and Wales (about 10% of the population aged 10 or over) have their DNA stored on the National DNA Database, one of the largest DNA databases in the world. Police routinely collect DNA from arrested suspects, and it can be stored (often permanently) if they are convicted of almost any offence.

    <h2><a href="/post/football-arrests/">Chart: More than 1,400 football arrests each season</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Over the past five years, more than 1,400 people have been arrested on average each season for football-related offences across the top five English divisions, with incidents reported at over 1,000 different matches. Most arrests are for violence, and about half are for offences outside the grounds themselves. More fans are arrested at away games, even though far fewer fans typically travel than attend home games. However, the rate of arrests at football matches overall is low, at about 3 arrests per 100,000 match spectators.

    <h2><a href="/post/drug-seizures/">Chart: Seizures of the most harmful drugs at UK borders are falling</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Border Force is responsible for seizing drugs at ports, airports and international parcels depots. However, reports by the Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration suggest drug-detection efforts are hindered by understaffing, lack of training and focus on conducting passport checks on travellers. Most drug seizures are of small amounts: only 19% of seizures involve more than one kilogram of drugs.

    <h2><a href="/post/use-of-force/">Chart: When police use force, they rarely cause injury</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Police reported using force on over 300,000 occasions last year, or about 850 each day, with most incidents involving either handcuffing or other restraint. Almost all force used by police resulted in no injury to the person force was used against. When officers did injure people, the injuries were usually minor. However, since these are new statistics there is likely to be some under-reporting, especially of minor incidents.

    <h2><a href="/post/prisoner-types/">Chart: Most prison sentences are for violent crimes</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      About 69,000 adults (more than 95% of them men) are currently serving prison sentences, most of them for violent or sexual offences. However, over 10,000 adults are serving sentences for drug offences, more than for all types of theft combined.

    <h2><a href="/post/crime-pressure/">Chart: In five years, crime-related demands on police have almost doubled</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      One way to understand crime-related demands on police forces is to track ‘crime pressure’, a measure of investigative workload representing the number of crimes reported to a force per officer, weighted according to Office for National Statistics estimates of the relative severity of different crimes. In the past five years, this measure has risen in every police force in England and Wales, and has doubled in many places.

    <h2><a href="/post/reoffending-rates/">Chart: Young offenders are more likely to re-offend than adults</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Most people convicted of a crime will not be convicted or cautioned for another offence within 12 months, although young offenders are more likely to offend again than adults. Most re-offending is by a small number of prolific offenders who frequently pass through the criminal justice system – more than 60% of people released from short prison sentences will reoffend within a year.

    <h2><a href="/post/knife-sentencing/">Chart: Sentences for knife carrying are increasing, but not for teens</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Sentences for carrying a bladed or pointed article have become more severe for adults over the past decade, with 41% of men now going to prison on conviction. For younger offenders, the picture is different: half of girls and a third of boys caught with a knife receive no penalty – a proportion that is largely unchanged since 2008 – while fewer than one in ten receive a custodial sentence.
