      <title>Chart: Much of the homicide drop has already been erased</title>

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;The rapid decrease in the homicide (murder, manslaughter and infanticide) rate in England and Wales between 2000 and 2014 was unprecedented over the previous century, but a third of that decrease has already been reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/homicide-trends_files/figure-html/display%20plot-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data sources: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/historical-crime-data&#34;&gt;Homicide counts 1898 to 2001/02&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/crimeinenglandandwalesappendixtables&#34;&gt;Homicide counts 2001/02 onwards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/datasets/populationestimatesforukenglandandwalesscotlandandnorthernireland&#34;&gt;Population estimates 1838 to 2018&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;notes&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This chart uses police-recorded homicide offences because that time series
extends further back in time than the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/articles/homicideinenglandandwales/yearendingmarch2018#how-is-homicide-defined-and-measured&#34;&gt;Home Office Homicide Index&lt;/a&gt;, the main
alternative source of homicide data. The main disadvantage of this approach is
that crimes that are initially recorded homicides in police data but are
subsequently discovered not to be will not be included in the Homicide Index
data but will be included in police-recorded counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victims of the Hillsborough disaster are recorded in ONS data as manslaughter
cases in the year ending March 2017 because that was when the revised inquest
verdicts were returned. However, in the chart above these cases are included in
the rate for 1989, when the deaths occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chart: Police are arresting half as many people as a decade ago</title>

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;A combination of legal changes and decreases in many common types of crime, together with closures of custody suites due to budget cuts, mean police are making about 760,000 fewer arrests per year now, compared to a decade ago. The number of children arrested has decreased fastest, potentially driven by recognition of the negative consequences of criminalising young people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/police-arrests_files/figure-html/display%20plot-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chart: Online crime now the most-likely threat to many businesses</title>

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;Online crime (including hacking, phishing and virus attacks) is now experienced by more businesses than any other type across sectors as varied as manufacturing and communications. But in the sectors most-likely to experience a crime (retail, accomodation and entertainment), traditional offences such as theft are still more likely. The data come from the government’s Commercial Victimisation Survey, which each year asks about crime against selected business types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/business-crime_files/figure-html/display%20plot-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chart: Most people think the justice system is fair, fewer say it&#39;s effective</title>

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;Every month, the Crime Survey for England and Wales asks a representative sample of adults about their perceptions of the criminal justice system. Across age, education, ethnic and employment groups, most people believe the system as a whole is fair, but only about half say it is effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/fairness-perception_files/figure-html/display%20plot-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chart: Drug use was falling, but that seems to be changing</title>

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;Self-reported drug use has fallen for most of the past 20 years according to the Crime Survey for England and Wales, but in the past seven years the use of cannabis, cocaine and ecstasy has increased substantially, particularly among people aged 16–24. However, drug use is still lower now than it was at the turn of the millenium, with about 10% of adults saying they’ve used an illegal drug in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/drug-use_files/figure-html/display%20plot-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chart: Over 10 years, basic police pay has fallen by 22% in real terms</title>

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;A combination of government-led changes to pay mean a police constable who has just completed initial training in England and Wales is paid about £6,700 less now than they would have been a decade ago, once inflation is taken into account. These figures exclude overtime and special allowances, but those are unlikely to have made up for decreasing basic pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/police-pay_files/figure-html/display%20plot-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pay for years before 2019 has been adjusted for inflation using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/timeseries/l522/mm23&#34;&gt;Office for
National Statistics preferred CPIH measure&lt;/a&gt;.
For 2019, second-quarter inflation estimates have been used.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chart: Homicide methods are changing</title>

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;Homicide (murder, manslaughter and infanticide) in England and Wales is rare, with about 12 homicides per million people last year, a similar rate to a decade ago. But homicide methods are changing: the rise in knife murders is well known, but there are other changes, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/homicide-methods_files/figure-html/display%20plot-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The homicide counts here exclude victims of the Hillsborough disaster, who died
in 1989 but were recorded as manslaughter cases in 2017, and victims of the
Manchester Arena bombing in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;Of the 663,000 non-motoring offences for which people were sentenced in 2018, only about 11% resulted in a prison sentence. Some convictions, like rape and robbery, almost always result in a prison sentence (at least for adult offenders), while other offences very rarely result in imprisonment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the 42 million adults in England and Wales aged between 16 and 74, 1.3 million have been sexually assaulted by a current or former partner, 4.3 million subjected to non-sexual assault and 2.3 million have been stalked. In every category, at least twice as many women as men have been victimised.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;There are almost 22,000 fewer police officers in England and Wales than in 2010, but numbers haven’t dropped equally across police forces. One force (Surrey) has the same number of officers now as 10 years ago, while officer numbers in forces like Humberside are increasing after steep cuts. But in almost half of forces, numbers are still falling despite a decade of often above-average cuts already.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chart: Fewer people are victims of common crimes than 30 years&#39; ago</title>

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;Across many common crime types, fewer people are victims now than 30 years’ ago. For example, for every 100 people who were a victim of vehicle-related theft at least once in 1987, only 25 people were a victim at least once in 2018. However, many of these crime types now appear to becoming slightly more common again.&lt;/p&gt;
