&lt;p&gt;Police can search people they suspect of having prohibited items such as drugs or weapons. Since 2011, searches have decreased by 70%. Only 12% of searches lead to arrest, but this is increasing – total arrests from searches have decreased only 38% since 2011, suggesting police are getting better at targeting offenders.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chart: Police crackdowns catch few drink drivers</title>

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;Police routinely breathalyse drivers they suspect have been drinking, but also carry out an annual Christmas crackdown, breath-testing more than three times as many drivers in December as in other months. However, only about 1.6% of these extra tests catch a drink driver, compared to about 14% of routine tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/breath-tests_files/figure-html/display%20plot-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;About 100 people a year die following contact with police in England and Wales. Public debate has often focused on deaths in custody or police shootings, but people are much more likely to die in collisions with police vehicles or in suicides following release from custody.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chart: More than 1,400 football arrests each season</title>

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;Over the past five years, more than 1,400 people have been arrested on average each season for football-related offences across the top five English divisions, with incidents reported at over 1,000 different matches. Most arrests are for violence, and about half are for offences outside the grounds themselves. More fans are arrested at away games, even though far fewer fans typically travel than attend home games. However, the rate of arrests at football matches overall is low, at about 3 arrests per 100,000 match spectators.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chart: When police use force, they rarely cause injury</title>

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;Police reported using force on over 300,000 occasions last year, or about 850 each day, with most incidents involving either handcuffing or other restraint. Almost all force used by police resulted in no injury to the person force was used against. When officers did injure people, the injuries were usually minor. However, since these are new statistics there is likely to be some under-reporting, especially of minor incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chart: In five years, crime-related demands on police have almost doubled</title>

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;One way to understand crime-related demands on police forces is to track ‘crime pressure’, a measure of investigative workload representing the number of crimes reported to a force per officer, weighted according to Office for National Statistics estimates of the relative severity of different crimes. In the past five years, this measure has risen in every police force in England and Wales, and has doubled in many places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/crime-pressure_files/figure-html/display%20plot-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/crimeseverityscoreexperimentalstatistics&#34;&gt;Office for National Statistics, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;notes&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Office for National Statistics (ONS) publishes &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/crimeseverityscoreexperimentalstatistics&#34;&gt;estimates of the severity of different types of police-recorded crime&lt;/a&gt;, derived from the average sentence imposed in court for each type of offence. In the same dataset, ONS publishes an overall estimate of the severity of crime per capita in each police force area. To convert this to an estimate of crime severity per officer (referred to above as &lt;em&gt;crime pressure&lt;/em&gt;), severity per capita was multiplied by police force area population&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and then divided by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/police-workforce-england-and-wales&#34;&gt;number of full-time equivalent police officers in each force&lt;/a&gt;. Crime pressure is therefore defined as the severity of police-recorded crime per full-time equivalent officer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estimates of the severity of different crimes are inherently limited, although they are likely to be more informative for some purposes than simply counting crimes (which implicitly assumes all crimes are of equal importance). For a further discussion of this, see &lt;a href=&#34;/publication/measuring_crime_harm/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Comparing methods for measuring crime harm/severity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chart: Police are arresting half as many people as a decade ago</title>

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;A combination of legal changes and decreases in many common types of crime, together with closures of custody suites due to budget cuts, mean police are making about 760,000 fewer arrests per year now, compared to a decade ago. The number of children arrested has decreased fastest, potentially driven by recognition of the negative consequences of criminalising young people.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chart: Over 10 years, basic police pay has fallen by 22% in real terms</title>

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;A combination of government-led changes to pay mean a police constable who has just completed initial training in England and Wales is paid about £6,700 less now than they would have been a decade ago, once inflation is taken into account. These figures exclude overtime and special allowances, but those are unlikely to have made up for decreasing basic pay.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;There are almost 22,000 fewer police officers in England and Wales than in 2010, but numbers haven’t dropped equally across police forces. One force (Surrey) has the same number of officers now as 10 years ago, while officer numbers in forces like Humberside are increasing after steep cuts. But in almost half of forces, numbers are still falling despite a decade of often above-average cuts already.&lt;/p&gt;
