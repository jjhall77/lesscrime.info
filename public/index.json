However, studying crime and place is often made more difficult by restrictions on access to appropriate crime data. This means understanding of many spatio-temporal crime patterns are limited to data from a single geographic setting, and there are few attempts at replication. This article introduces the Crime Open Database (CODE), a database of 16 million offenses from 10 of the largest United States cities over 11 years and more than 60 offense types. Open crime data were obtained from each city, having been published in multiple incompatible formats. The data were processed to harmonize geographic co-ordinates, dates and times, offense categories and location types, as well as adding census and other geographic identifiers. The resulting database allows the wider study of spatio-temporal patterns of crime across multiple US cities, allowing greater understanding of variations in the relationships between crime and place across different settings, as well as facilitating replication of research.","tags":[],"title":"Studying crime and place with the Crime Open Database","type":"publication"},{"authors":["MPJ Ashby"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1553558400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553558400,"objectID":"cd249aec1205b9861c14d6f3b4401c78","permalink":"/publication/violence_around_schools/","publishdate":"2019-03-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/violence_around_schools/","section":"publication","summary":" Objectives: Research evidence on schools as a factor in the distribution of neighborhood violence has produced varying and at-times directly contradictory results. Drawing conclusions from existing research is also complicated by data limitations and methodological differences. The present study sought to further research in this area using a novel open-data source.\nMethods: Police-recorded assault and personal robbery data from nine large US cities were used to test four hypotheses (derived from the routine activities approach) on spatio-temporal patterns of violence around schools. Multi-level Markov Chain Monte Carlo models were used to reflect the clustered structure of the data.\nResults: The presence of a public secondary (middle or high) school in a census block group was associated with higher daytime assault and robbery counts on weekdays when schools were in session but not on non-school weekdays, and the effect was larger for larger schools. No such relationships were found for elementary schools. However, there were variations between cities, in that there was no effect in one city and the effect sizes in other cities varied substantially.\nConclusions: The results were consistent with the routine activites approach, suggesting a role for middle and high schools in the distribution of neighbourhood violence. The differences between cities suggest that studying multiple cities is important in the investigation of crime and place, and that open data may provide a mechanism for overcoming the data-access difficulties that have previously limited multi-city studies of spatio-temporal variations in crime.

This study proposes a police action model that facilitates a more-holistic analysis of individual and situational influences on police actions. This model is used to generate hypotheses about the relationship between police stop and search/frisk and weather (temperature and precipitation) in London and New York City. After controlling for other situational factors (such as public holidays and special events) and for the frequency of street crime, increasing temperatures are associated with small increases in police stops, while precipitation (rain and snow) is associated with substantial decreases. These relationships disappear, however, when stops conducted indoors (e.g. in shopping malls) are modeled.

Failure to do so may jeopardize the societal, environmental and health benefits of public transportation. One challenge with securing transit environments comes from the difficulty of accurately estimating the risk of criminal victimization at various nodes, particularly with respect to the choice of denominator that most reliably captures variations in the number of opportunities for different crime types. In this paper, we draw on open-source data as denominators for calculating the risk of violent crime on London Underground. We argue that denominator choice can depend on the ease of availability, accuracy and applicability of the data required, and demonstrate how the choice of denominator significantly affects estimations of crime risk. We make recommendations for research, policy and practice in denominator choice, and finally integrate the results to develop a taxonomy of London Underground stations based on their risk profiles across all measures.","tags":[],"title":"Alternative denominators in transport crime rates","type":"publication"},{"authors":["MPJ Ashby"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1503446400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1503446400,"objectID":"bf2d597482ba2e69101286a9c7140aac","permalink":"/publication/measuring_crime_harm/","publishdate":"2017-08-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/measuring_crime_harm/","section":"publication","summary":"Ensuring police resources are focused where they are most needed requires understanding of the consequences of crime in relation to offenders, victims, and places. Most crime analysis is based on counts of crimes, but not all crimes are equivalent to one another. Researchers have recently developed two methods—the Crime Harm Index and the Crime Severity Score—for weighting crime counts according to the severity of different crime types. This article compares these two methods by applying them to two common crime-analysis scenarios: focusing resources on the most-important types of crime and in the areas most affected by crime. The two measures are found to produce substantially different results when other factors are held constant. The results of severity-weighted crime analysis (and the decision made based on them) could therefore be greatly influenced by the method chosen.

CCTV was available to investigators in 45% of cases and judged to be useful in 29% (65% of cases in which it was available). Useful CCTV was associated with significantly increased chances of crimes being solved for all crime types except drugs/weapons possession and fraud. Images were more likely to be available for more-serious crimes, and less likely to be available for cases occurring at unknown times or in certain types of locations. Although this research was limited to offences on railways, it appears that CCTV is a powerful investigative tool for many types of crime. The usefulness of CCTV is limited by several factors, most notably the number of public areas not covered.

The most common self-guardianship measure was to use only ATMs believed to be safe. The majority of customers did not cover the ATM keypad while entering their personal identification number, despite long-running publicity campaigns encouraging this behaviour. This suggests that self-guardianship is important at ATMs, but many customers fail to take even basic measures to protect themselves, their money and their bank details from theft.

There are considerable practical, logistical, and ethical benefits to using such secondary data. Child sexual exploitation is a highly sensitive and largely hidden issue that is notoriously difficult to research. Consequently, we benefitted greatly from the unobtrusive approach, increased reach, and cost- effectiveness that our research design permitted. Nonetheless, there can also be substantial challenges associated with working with secondary data not generated for research purposes. Among the key barriers we encountered were lack of clarity around key terms and fundamental parameters, missing data, and difficulties finding appropriate baselines against which to interpret our results. We will discuss approaches we took to mitigate these challenges and to ensure high-quality research outputs. Finally, we will reflect on some more general lessons both for the providers and for the users of non-research-oriented secondary data.

This thesis uses the paradigm of crime science to analyse the problem, focusing on thefts from the railway network in Great Britain. Two theoretical concepts are used: crime scripts and the routine-activities approach. Police-recorded crime and intelligence data are used to develop a crime script, which in turn is used to identify features of the problem a) analysis of which would potentially be useful to practitioners seeking to understand and prevent metal theft, and b) for which sufficient data are available to make analysis practical. Three such features are then analysed in more detail. First, spatial and temporal distributions of metal theft are analysed. Metal theft appears to differ from other types of acquisitive crime in ways potentially useful for prevention, for example in clustering outside (but close to) cities, and in exhibiting significant repeat victimisation over a longer period than found for other crimes. Second, the potential crime-prevention value of the market-reduction approach is analysed by testing for clusters of thefts close to the locations of scrap-metal dealers. Scrap-yard locations are found to be a significant predictor of local thefts, controlling for metal availability, area accessibility, and density of population and industry. Third, the involvement of organised crime groups (OCGs) in metal theft is tested. Due to the difficulty of defining and measuring organised crime, multiple approaches are used: all show OCG involvement to be rarer than official estimates previously suggested. The implications of these findings for practitioners are discussed. The thesis also considers the relevance of the results for the use of crime science and the analysis of OCGs.","tags":null,"title":"Using crime science for understanding and preventing theft of metal from the British railway network","type":"publication"},{"authors":["E Cockbain","MPJ Ashby","H Brayley"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1448928000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1448928000,"objectID":"42d0622615cbed380edc92ebbfa9309a","permalink":"/publication/immaterial_boys/","publishdate":"2015-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/immaterial_boys/","section":"publication","summary":"Child sexual exploitation is increasingly recognized nationally and internationally as a pressing child protection, crime prevention, and public health issue.

OLS regression results indicated that routine activity variables (e.g. day of the week, periods of high demand for police service) can explain a large proportion of the variance in search frequency throughout the year. A complex set of results emerged, revealing cross-national dissimilarities and the differential impact of certain activities (e.g. public holidays).

The purpose of this document is to provide a brief synthesis of key findings from recent exploratory research on the sexual exploitation of young males in the UK.","tags":null,"title":"Research on the Sexual Exploitation of Boys and Young Men: a UK scoping study, a summary of the findings","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A Sidebottom","MPJ Ashby","SD Johnson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1394755200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1394755200,"objectID":"776bbb661fb47dc89dfdcdb93d7d5d29","permalink":"/publication/metal_price_theft_hypothesis/","publishdate":"2014-03-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/metal_price_theft_hypothesis/","section":"publication","summary":"To test the commonly espoused but little examined hypothesis that fluctuations in the price of metal are associated with changes in the volume of metal theft. Specifically, we analyze the relationship between the price of copper and the number of police recorded “live” copper cable thefts from the British railway network (2006 to 2012). Time-series analysis was performed using 76 months of data to determine the association between mean copper price and police recorded “live” copper cable theft. Two rival hypotheses, that changes in the theft of copper cabling reflect changes in the theft of railway property more generally (or the reporting thereof) or variations in the rate of unemployment, were also tested. We find support for the price–theft hypothesis: Changes in the price of copper were positively associated with variations in the volume of “live” copper cable theft. A downward trend in copper cable theft in recent years is also observed, although the mechanism/mechanisms underpinning this pattern is unclear. The theft of “live” copper cable is associated with fluctuations in copper price. As such, it differs substantially from the “crime drop” typically noted for most types of crime providing further support for the price–theft hypothesis.","tags":null,"title":"Copper cable theft: revisiting the price–theft hypothesis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["MPJ Ashby","KJ Bowers"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1369267200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1369267200,"objectID":"24114e08bdd9cde6b0d7eab78ea02862","permalink":"/publication/aoristic_methods/","publishdate":"2013-05-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/aoristic_methods/","section":"publication","summary":"To test the accuracy of various methods previously proposed (and one new method) to estimate offence times where the actual time of the event is not known. For 303 thefts of pedal cycles from railway stations, the actual offence time was determined from closed-circuit television and the resulting temporal distribution compared against commonly-used estimated distributions using circular statistics and analysis of residuals. Aoristic analysis and allocation of a random time to each offence allow accurate estimation of peak offence times. Commonly-used deterministic methods were found to be inaccurate and to produce misleading results. It is important that analysts use the most accurate methods for temporal distribution approximation to ensure any resource decisions made on the basis of peak times are reliable.","tags":null,"title":"A comparison of methods for temporal analysis of aoristic crime","type":"publication"}]
