As an example, we’ll use a file containing population estimates for each nation within the United Kingdom by five-year age groups.\nWhy do this? It might be tempting not to clean the data in R but instead simply open the relevant file in Excel and make the necessary changes there. This will work, but there are at least three reasons why cleaning the data in Excel is not necessarily a good idea.\n It’s harder to repeat the process. For example, if ONS updates the table (either because new data is available or to correct a problem) then you have to repeat the manual process in Excel. If you clean the data in R, typically all you have to do is run the script again. It’s harder to find mistakes. If you make a mistake while changing data in Excel but don’t notice until later (e.g. if your results don’t make sense) it will be difficult to track down exactly what happened. If you use a script to clean the data, you can go back and run it line-by-line to identify the problem. It’s harder for others to trust your work. If someone else wants to check your analysis (e.g. before taking action based on it), that’s more difficult if you have manipulated the data manually in ways the other person cannot see.   Before you start This tutorial assumes you have R installed and that you’re comfortable with the basics of using R to manipulate data. If you don’t have the tidyverse collection of packages installed already, run install.packages(\u0026quot;tidyverse\u0026quot;) before continuing. It also a good idea to run this code from inside a project.\n Download the data Although ONS is relatively good at providing archive data, it’s good practice to always save an unamended copy of the raw data for any project just in case it later disappears from the source website.\n# download the data file download.file( url = \u0026quot;https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/datasets/populationestimatesforukenglandandwalesscotlandandnorthernireland/mid20182019laboundaries/ukmidyearestimates20182019ladcodes.xls\u0026quot;, destfile = \u0026quot;ons_pop_data.xls\u0026quot; )  Load the data into R Since the data are in an Excel file, we can use the readxl package to read it into R2. ONS publishes data using a mixture of file formats, including both the pre-2007 Excel .xls file format and the current .xlsx format3. The read_excel() function can handle both .xls and .xlsx files, but can only load a single sheet from within an Excel workbook (i.e. file). We can use the excel_sheets() function to get the names of each sheet in the Excel file.\nlibrary(\u0026quot;readxl\u0026quot;) library(\u0026quot;tidyverse\u0026quot;) ## ── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.2.1 ── ## ✔ ggplot2 3.2.1 ✔ purrr 0.3.2 ## ✔ tibble 2.1.3 ✔ dplyr 0.8.3 ## ✔ tidyr 0.8.3 ✔ stringr 1.4.0 ## ✔ readr 1.3.1 ✔ forcats 0.4.0 ## ── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ── ## ✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter() ## ✖ dplyr::lag() masks stats::lag() excel_sheets(\u0026quot;ons_pop_data.xls\u0026quot;) ## [1] \u0026quot;Contents \u0026quot; \u0026quot;Terms and conditions \u0026quot; ## [3] \u0026quot;Notes and definitions\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Admin. geography hierarchy\u0026quot; ## [5] \u0026quot;MYE1\u0026quot; \u0026quot;MYE2-All\u0026quot; ## [7] \u0026quot;MYE2 - Males\u0026quot; \u0026quot;MYE2 - Females\u0026quot; ## [9] \u0026quot;MYE3\u0026quot; \u0026quot;MYE4 \u0026quot; ## [11] \u0026quot;MYE 5\u0026quot; \u0026quot;MYE 6\u0026quot; ## [13] \u0026quot;Related publications\u0026quot; Note that some of the sheets have a space at the end of the name, which will be invisible when viewing the file in Excel but which we need to know about to specify the sheet name for read_excel().\nThe Contents sheet contains a short description of the data in each of the other sheets.

We can either specify the cell range manually (e.g. range = \u0026quot;A5:H31\u0026quot;) or we can use one of the cell_* collection of helper functions from the cellranger package, which is loaded with readxl.\nWe can work out which cells we want to retain either by opening the file in Excel and noting which rows contain the data, or by running View(file_data) in R and then adjusting the value of range = in read_excel() until we are happy with the result.\nfile_data \u0026lt;- read_excel(\u0026quot;ons_pop_data.xls\u0026quot;, sheet = \u0026quot;MYE1\u0026quot;, range = cell_rows(5:31) ) file_data ## # A tibble: 26 x 8 ## `Country / Code` K02000001 K03000001 K04000001 E92000001 W92000004 ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; ## 1 \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; UNITED K… GREAT BR… ENGLAND … ENGLAND WALES ## 2 \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; ## 3 All Persons 66435550 64553909 59115809 55977178 3138631 ## 4 Males 32790202 31864002 29215251 27667942 1547309 ## 5 Females 33645348 32689907 29900558 28309236 1591322 ## 6 \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; ## 7 Age Groups \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; ## 8 0-4 3914028 3792292 3515430 3346727 168703 ## 9 5-9 4138524 4009409 3708320 3523866 184454 ## 10 10-14 3858894 3738572 3450782 3274119 176663 ## # … with 16 more rows, and 2 more variables: S92000003 \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt;, ## # N92000002 \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; This deals with the unwanted rows above and below the table, as well as the unwanted columns produced because of the feedback questionnaire.\nThe next problem is that the column names represent the GSS statistical codes for the different nations of the UK, rather than the names of the nations.

These are some of the issues I’ve come across and potential ways to deal with them.\n(The examples below all assume your data is in a data frame/tibble called data.)\nMissing values in the data Many ONS datasets have missing values, and some even have multiple values representing different reasons for the values being missing. For example, data for small geographic areas might be missing because the data could not be collected for a particular location or have been redacted to prevent disclosure of personal information.\nThe na = parameter of read_excel() can be used to specify values in the data that should be treated as missing. For example, if an ONS table uses a blank cell to represent data that could not be collected and ** to represent redacted data, read_excel(\u0026quot;data.xlsx\u0026quot;, sheet = \u0026quot;Sheet 1\u0026quot;, na = c(\u0026quot;\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;**\u0026quot;)) will ensure both values are represented by NA in R.\nIt isn’t possible to use drop_na() to remove empty rows if there are missing values in the data, because drop_na() removes rows that contain any missing values. Instead, you can use remove_empty() from the janitor package to remove rows or columns that are entirely empty. If there are rows that you want to remove from the data that contain some missing values and some values that are not missing, use filter() from dplyr based on the value of a specific column. For example, to remove rows with the value of population missing, use filter(data, !is.na(population)). To remove single rows manually by row number, use slice(), also from dplyr.\n Multiple tables in a single sheet Sometimes multiple related data tables are placed on a single Excel sheet. You can either import them separately and then combine the resulting datasets manually (e.g. with rbind()) or just treat the rows or columns between each table as clutter that can be removed using a combination of drop_na() and slice() as above. In the latter case, modify the range = argument of read_excel() so that the selected cells/rows/columns include all the tables.\n Category names or values with footnote markers If tables have multiple footnotes, some categories or values may end in a footnote marker (typically a number). To remove these, use str_remove() from stringr. For example, if the column place contains values with footnote markers, you can use mutate(data, place = str_remove(place, \u0026quot;\\\\d+$\u0026quot;)) to remove them, where \\\\d+ is a regular expression that matches one or more numeric characters and $ matches only numeric characters at the end of the value of place. This only works for non-numeric values with numeric footnote markers, since the regular expression \\\\d+$ will match any sequence of numbers at the end of a cell.\n Dates and date ranges stored as text Since many ONS statistics are published for financial years, time periods are often stored as strings showing, for example, 2018-19. Converting these to dates helps with things like plotting values on an axis with date values or using the data in a time-series model.\nThe lubridate package is very useful for converting dates. You can either represent each date as a specific moment in time, or as an interval in time. For example, if a financial year is stored as 2018-19 in the year column, you can extract the specific moment the year started using mutate(year_beginning = ymd(paste(str_sub(year, 0, 4)), \u0026quot;04\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;01\u0026quot;)). In this code, str_sub(year, 0, 4) extracts the first four characters from the string 2018-19, paste() creates a single character value for 1 April in the given year (e.g. 2018 04 01) and ymd() converts that string into a date object.\nTo store a date as an interval, we extract both the date on which the year started and the date it ended. For example,\nmutate( data, year_interval = interval( ymd(paste(str_sub(year, 0, 4), \u0026quot;04\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;01\u0026quot;)), ymd(paste(str_sub(year, -2), \u0026quot;03\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;31\u0026quot;)) ) )  R session information The code in this tutorial was run in R with the following configuration:\n## R version 3.6.0 (2019-04-26) ## Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin15.6.0 (64-bit) ## Running under: macOS Mojave 10.14.5 ## ## Matrix products: default ## BLAS: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.6/Resources/lib/libRblas.0.dylib ## LAPACK: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.6/Resources/lib/libRlapack.dylib ## ## locale: ## [1] en_GB.UTF-8/en_GB.UTF-8/en_GB.UTF-8/C/en_GB.UTF-8/en_GB.UTF-8 ## ## attached base packages: ## [1] stats graphics grDevices utils datasets methods base ## ## other attached packages: ## [1] lubridate_1.7.4 magrittr_1.5 forcats_0.4.0 stringr_1.4.0 ## [5] dplyr_0.8.3 purrr_0.3.2 readr_1.3.1 tidyr_0.8.3 ## [9] tibble_2.1.3 ggplot2_3.2.1 tidyverse_1.2.1 readxl_1.3.1 ## ## loaded via a namespace (and not attached): ## [1] Rcpp_1.0.2 cellranger_1.1.0 pillar_1.4.2 compiler_3.6.0 ## [5] tools_3.6.0 zeallot_0.1.0 digest_0.6.20 jsonlite_1.6 ## [9] evaluate_0.14 nlme_3.1-141 gtable_0.3.0 lattice_0.20-38 ## [13] pkgconfig_2.0.2 rlang_0.4.0 cli_1.1.0 rstudioapi_0.10 ## [17] yaml_2.2.0 haven_2.1.1 blogdown_0.14 xfun_0.8 ## [21] withr_2.1.2 xml2_1.2.2 httr_1.4.1 knitr_1.24 ## [25] vctrs_0.2.0 hms_0.5.0 generics_0.0.2 grid_3.6.0 ## [29] tidyselect_0.2.5 glue_1.3.1 R6_2.4.0 fansi_0.4.0 ## [33] rmarkdown_1.14 bookdown_0.12 modelr_0.1.5 backports_1.1.4 ## [37] scales_1.0.0 htmltools_0.3.6 rvest_0.3.4 assertthat_0.2.1 ## [41] colorspace_1.4-1 utf8_1.1.4 stringi_1.4.3 lazyeval_0.2.2 ## [45] munsell_0.5.0 broom_0.5.2 crayon_1.3.4    ONS refers to this as ‘open data’, although (almost) all the products it produces are already open licensed under the Open Government Licence↩\n The readxl package is installed as part of the tidyverse but is not automatically loaded by library(\u0026quot;tidyverse\u0026quot;).↩\n I have not been able to work out why some ONS files are in .xls format and some in .xlsx.↩\n   ","date":1567123200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567123200,"objectID":"c04a8b56662656054edcf616f476b477","permalink":"/post/cleaning-ons-data/","publishdate":"2019-08-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/cleaning-ons-data/","section":"post","summary":"UK Office for National Statistics data can be in formats that are hard to analyse.

However, studying crime and place is often made more difficult by restrictions on access to appropriate crime data. This means understanding of many spatio-temporal crime patterns are limited to data from a single geographic setting, and there are few attempts at replication. This article introduces the Crime Open Database (CODE), a database of 16 million offenses from 10 of the largest United States cities over 11 years and more than 60 offense types.

Drawing conclusions from existing research is also complicated by data limitations and methodological differences. The present study sought to further research in this area using a novel open-data source.\nMethods: Police-recorded assault and personal robbery data from nine large US cities were used to test four hypotheses (derived from the routine activities approach) on spatio-temporal patterns of violence around schools. Multi-level Markov Chain Monte Carlo models were used to reflect the clustered structure of the data.\nResults: The presence of a public secondary (middle or high) school in a census block group was associated with higher daytime assault and robbery counts on weekdays when schools were in session but not on non-school weekdays, and the effect was larger for larger schools. No such relationships were found for elementary schools. However, there were variations between cities, in that there was no effect in one city and the effect sizes in other cities varied substantially.\nConclusions: The results were consistent with the routine activites approach, suggesting a role for middle and high schools in the distribution of neighbourhood violence. The differences between cities suggest that studying multiple cities is important in the investigation of crime and place, and that open data may provide a mechanism for overcoming the data-access difficulties that have previously limited multi-city studies of spatio-temporal variations in crime.

This study proposes a police action model that facilitates a more-holistic analysis of individual and situational influences on police actions. This model is used to generate hypotheses about the relationship between police stop and search/frisk and weather (temperature and precipitation) in London and New York City. After controlling for other situational factors (such as public holidays and special events) and for the frequency of street crime, increasing temperatures are associated with small increases in police stops, while precipitation (rain and snow) is associated with substantial decreases. These relationships disappear, however, when stops conducted indoors (e.g. in shopping malls) are modeled.

Failure to do so may jeopardize the societal, environmental and health benefits of public transportation. One challenge with securing transit environments comes from the difficulty of accurately estimating the risk of criminal victimization at various nodes, particularly with respect to the choice of denominator that most reliably captures variations in the number of opportunities for different crime types. In this paper, we draw on open-source data as denominators for calculating the risk of violent crime on London Underground. We argue that denominator choice can depend on the ease of availability, accuracy and applicability of the data required, and demonstrate how the choice of denominator significantly affects estimations of crime risk. We make recommendations for research, policy and practice in denominator choice, and finally integrate the results to develop a taxonomy of London Underground stations based on their risk profiles across all measures.","tags":[],"title":"Alternative denominators in transport crime rates","type":"publication"},{"authors":["MPJ Ashby"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1503446400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1503446400,"objectID":"bf2d597482ba2e69101286a9c7140aac","permalink":"/publication/measuring_crime_harm/","publishdate":"2017-08-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/measuring_crime_harm/","section":"publication","summary":"Ensuring police resources are focused where they are most needed requires understanding of the consequences of crime in relation to offenders, victims, and places. Most crime analysis is based on counts of crimes, but not all crimes are equivalent to one another. Researchers have recently developed two methods—the Crime Harm Index and the Crime Severity Score—for weighting crime counts according to the severity of different crime types. This article compares these two methods by applying them to two common crime-analysis scenarios: focusing resources on the most-important types of crime and in the areas most affected by crime. The two measures are found to produce substantially different results when other factors are held constant. The results of severity-weighted crime analysis (and the decision made based on them) could therefore be greatly influenced by the method chosen.

CCTV was available to investigators in 45% of cases and judged to be useful in 29% (65% of cases in which it was available). Useful CCTV was associated with significantly increased chances of crimes being solved for all crime types except drugs/weapons possession and fraud. Images were more likely to be available for more-serious crimes, and less likely to be available for cases occurring at unknown times or in certain types of locations. Although this research was limited to offences on railways, it appears that CCTV is a powerful investigative tool for many types of crime.

The most common self-guardianship measure was to use only ATMs believed to be safe. The majority of customers did not cover the ATM keypad while entering their personal identification number, despite long-running publicity campaigns encouraging this behaviour. This suggests that self-guardianship is important at ATMs, but many customers fail to take even basic measures to protect themselves, their money and their bank details from theft.

Child sexual exploitation is a highly sensitive and largely hidden issue that is notoriously difficult to research. Consequently, we benefitted greatly from the unobtrusive approach, increased reach, and cost- effectiveness that our research design permitted. Nonetheless, there can also be substantial challenges associated with working with secondary data not generated for research purposes. Among the key barriers we encountered were lack of clarity around key terms and fundamental parameters, missing data, and difficulties finding appropriate baselines against which to interpret our results. We will discuss approaches we took to mitigate these challenges and to ensure high-quality research outputs. Finally, we will reflect on some more general lessons both for the providers and for the users of non-research-oriented secondary data.

This thesis uses the paradigm of crime science to analyse the problem, focusing on thefts from the railway network in Great Britain. Two theoretical concepts are used: crime scripts and the routine-activities approach. Police-recorded crime and intelligence data are used to develop a crime script, which in turn is used to identify features of the problem a) analysis of which would potentially be useful to practitioners seeking to understand and prevent metal theft, and b) for which sufficient data are available to make analysis practical. Three such features are then analysed in more detail. First, spatial and temporal distributions of metal theft are analysed. Metal theft appears to differ from other types of acquisitive crime in ways potentially useful for prevention, for example in clustering outside (but close to) cities, and in exhibiting significant repeat victimisation over a longer period than found for other crimes. Second, the potential crime-prevention value of the market-reduction approach is analysed by testing for clusters of thefts close to the locations of scrap-metal dealers. Scrap-yard locations are found to be a significant predictor of local thefts, controlling for metal availability, area accessibility, and density of population and industry. Third, the involvement of organised crime groups (OCGs) in metal theft is tested. Due to the difficulty of defining and measuring organised crime, multiple approaches are used: all show OCG involvement to be rarer than official estimates previously suggested. The implications of these findings for practitioners are discussed. The thesis also considers the relevance of the results for the use of crime science and the analysis of OCGs.","tags":null,"title":"Using crime science for understanding and preventing theft of metal from the British railway network","type":"publication"},{"authors":["E Cockbain","MPJ Ashby","H Brayley"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1448928000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1448928000,"objectID":"42d0622615cbed380edc92ebbfa9309a","permalink":"/publication/immaterial_boys/","publishdate":"2015-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/immaterial_boys/","section":"publication","summary":"Child sexual exploitation is increasingly recognized nationally and internationally as a pressing child protection, crime prevention, and public health issue.

OLS regression results indicated that routine activity variables (e.g. day of the week, periods of high demand for police service) can explain a large proportion of the variance in search frequency throughout the year. A complex set of results emerged, revealing cross-national dissimilarities and the differential impact of certain activities (e.g. public holidays).
