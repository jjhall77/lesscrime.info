<p>A combination of government-led changes to pay mean a police constable who has just completed initial training in England and Wales is paid about Â£6,700 less now than they would have been a decade ago, once inflation is taken into account. These figures exclude overtime and special allowances, but those are unlikely to have made up for decreasing basic pay.</p>
