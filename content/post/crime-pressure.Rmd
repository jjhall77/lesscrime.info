### Notes

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) publishes [estimates of the severity of different types of police-recorded crime](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/crimeseverityscoreexperimentalstatistics), derived from the average sentence imposed in court for each type of offence. In the same dataset, ONS publishes an overall estimate of the severity of crime per capita in each police force area. To convert this to an estimate of crime severity per officer (referred to above as _crime pressure_), severity per capita was multiplied by police force area population[^fn1] and then divided by the [number of full-time equivalent police officers in each force](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/police-workforce-england-and-wales). Crime pressure is therefore defined as the severity of police-recorded crime per full-time equivalent officer.

Estimates of the severity of different crimes are inherently limited, although they are likely to be more informative for some purposes than simply counting crimes (which implicitly assumes all crimes are of equal importance). For a further discussion of this, see [_Comparing methods for measuring crime harm/severity_](/publication/measuring_crime_harm/).

[^fn1]: Police force area populations were calculated by aggregating [mid-year population estimates for local authorities](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/datasets/populationestimatesforukenglandandwalesscotlandandnorthernireland) to police force areas using the ONS open geography portal [local authority to police force lookup table](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/local-authority-district-to-community-safety-partnerships-to-police-force-areas-december-2018-lookup-in-england-and-wales).
