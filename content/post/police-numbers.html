<p>There are almost 22,000 fewer police officers in England and Wales than in 2010, but numbers havenâ€™t dropped equally across police forces. One force (Surrey) has more officers now than 10 years ago, while officer numbers in forces like Humberside are increasing after steep cuts. But in almost half of forces, numbers are still falling despite a decade of often above-average cuts already.</p>
