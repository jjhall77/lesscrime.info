<p>Of the 720,000 non-motoring offences for which people were sentenced in 2017, only about 10% resulted in a prison sentence. Some convictions, like rape and robbery, almost always result in a prison sentence (at least for adult offenders), while other offences very rarely result in imprisonment.</p>
